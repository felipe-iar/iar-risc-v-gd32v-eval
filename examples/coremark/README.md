# CoreMark 1.0 

* Target: IAR RISC-V GD32V Evaluation Board

## Introduction

CoreMark is a benchmark that measures the performance of central processing units (CPU) used in embedded systems. It was developed in 2009 by Shay Gal-On at [EEMBC](https://www.eembc.org) and it quickly became an industry standard. 

The code is written in C and contains implementations of the following algorithms: list processing (find and sort), matrix manipulation (common matrix operations), state machine (determine if an input stream contains valid numbers), and CRC.

By running the code on a target, a __CoreMark score__ is obtained. The better a compiler is in generating optimized code for the target CPU, the higher the __CoreMark score__ it gets. 

## Building and Running
	
To build and run the benchmark, select `Project → Make` (or <kbd>F7</kbd>)

Once the build is complete, connect your evaluation board debugger 20-pin header to the I-jet debugging probe and then select `Project → Download and Debug` (or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>)

The IDE will slightly change its initial appearance and new menu options will become available as it enters in debug mode.
This project uses the integrated IAR Embedded Workbench virtual terminal to output the benchmark results.

In order to see the results, select `View → Terminal I/O`

A new window named __Terminal I/O__ will show up without any output so far.
Next, execute the program by selecting `Debug → Go` (or <kbd>F5</kbd>)

The program will execute for about 10 seconds and once it finishes, it will print out the __Coremark score__ for your evaluation board.

> __Note__
> * According to the CoreMark [rules](#run-rules), the source files named core* cannot be touched. The only exception to that rule are the __core_portme__ files.
> * A typical way to compare the scores from different cores/compilers combinations is to rate them by __CoreMark/MHz__.
> * If you wish to know how many CoreMark/MHz your board got, do the math! It is as easy as taking the *CoreMark score* and dividing it by 108 MHz.

# Theory of Operation

This section describes the initial goals of CoreMark and their implementation.

## Small and easy to understand

* X number of source code lines for timed portion of the benchmark.
* Meaningful names for variables and functions.
* Comments for each block of code more than 10 lines long.

## Portability

A thin abstraction layer will be provided for I/O and timing in a separate file. All I/O and timing of the benchmark will be done through this layer.

### Code / data size

* Compile and make sure all sizes are according to requirements. 
* If dynamic memory allocation is used, take total memory allocated into account as well. 
* Avoid recursive functions and keep track of stack usage.
* Use the same memory block as data site for all algorithms, and initialize the data before each algorithm – while this means that initialization with data happens during the timed portion, it will only happen once during the timed portion and so have negligible effect on the results.

## Controlled output

This may be the most difficult goal. Compilers are constantly improving and getting better at analyzing code. To create work that cannot be computed at compile time and must be computed at run time, we will rely on two assumptions:

* Some system functions (e.g. time, scanf) and parameters cannot be computed at compile time.  In most cases, marking a variable volatile means the compiler is force to read this variable every time it is read. This will be used to introduce a factor into the input that cannot be precomputed at compile time. Since the results are input dependent, that will make sure that computation has to happen at run time.

* Either a system function or I/O (e.g. scanf) or command line parameters or volatile variables will be used before the timed portion to generate data which is not available at compile time. Specific method used is not relevant as long as it can be controlled, and that it cannot be computed or eliminated by the compiler at compile time. E.g. if the clock() functions is a compiler stub, it may not be used. The derived values will be reported on the output so that verification can be done on a different machine. 

* We cannot rely on command line parameters since some embedded systems do not have the capability to provide command line parameters. All 3 methods above will be implemented (time based, scanf and command line parameters) and all 3 are valid if the compiler cannot determine the value at compile time. 

* It is important to note that The actual values that are to be supplied at run time will be standardized. The methodology is not intended to provide random data, but simply to provide controlled data that cannot be precomputed at compile time.

* Printed results must be valid at run time. This will be used to make sure the computation has been executed.

* Some embedded systems do not provide “printf” or other I/O functionality. All I/O will be done through a thin abstraction interface to allow execution on such systems (e.g. allow output via JTAG).

## Key Algorithms

### Linked List

The following linked list structure will be used:

~~~
typedef struct list_data_s {
	ee_s16 data16;
	ee_s16 idx;
} list_data;

typedef struct list_head_s {
	struct list_head_s *next;
	struct list_data_s *info;
} list_head;
~~~

While adding a level of indirection accessing the data, this structure is realistic and used in many embedded applications for small to medium lists.

The list itself will be initialized on a block of memory that will be passed in to the initialization function. While in general linked lists use malloc for new nodes, embedded applications sometime control the memory for small data structures such as arrays and lists directly to avoid the overhead of system calls, so this approach is realistic.

The linked list will be initialized such that 1/4 of the list pointers point to sequential areas in memory, and 3/4 of the list pointers are distributed in a non sequential manner. This is done to emulate a linked list that had add/remove happen for a while disrupting the neat order, and then a series of adds that are likely to come from sequential memory locations.

For the benchmark itself:
- Multiple find operations are going to be performed. These find operations may result in the whole list being traversed. The result of each find will become part of the output chain.
- The list will be sorted using merge sort based on the data16 value, and then derive CRC of the data16 item in order for part of the list. The CRC will become part of the output chain.
- The list will be sorted again using merge sort based on the idx value. This sort will guarantee that the list is returned to the primary state before leaving the function, so that multiple iterations of the function will have the same result. CRC of the data16 for part of the list will again be calculated and become part of the output chain.

The actual `data16` in each cell will be pseudo random based on a single 16b input that cannot be determined at compile time. In addition, the part of the list which is used for CRC will also be passed to the function, and determined based on an input that cannot be determined at run time.

### Matrix Multiply

This very simple algorithm forms the basis of many more complex algorithms. The tight inner loop is the focus of many optimizations (compiler as well as hardware based) and is thus relevant for embedded processing. 

The total available data space will be divided to 3 parts:
1. NxN matrix A.
2. NxN matrix B.
3. NxN matrix C.

E.g. for 2K we will have 3 12x12 matrices (assuming data type of 32b 12(len)*12(wid)*4(size)*3(num) =1728 bytes). 

Matrix A will be initialized with small values (upper 3/4 of the bits all zero).
Matrix B will be initialized with medium values (upper half of the bits all zero).
Matrix C will be used for the result.

For the benchmark itself:
- Multiple A by a constant into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.
- Multiple A by column X of B into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.
- Multiple A by B into C, add the upper bits of each of the values in the result matrix. The result will become part of the output chain.

The actual values for A and B must be derived based on input that is not available at compile time.

### State Machine

This part of the code needs to exercise switch and if statements. As such, we will use a small Moore state machine. In particular, this will be a state machine that identifies string input as numbers and divides them according to format.

The state machine will parse the input string until either a “,” separator or end of input is encountered. An invalid number will cause the state machine to return invalid state and a valid number will cause the state machine to return with type of number format (int/float/scientific).

This code will perform a realistic task, be small enough to easily understand, and exercise the required functionality. The other option used in embedded systems is a mealy based state machine, which is driven by a table. The table then determines the number of states and complexity of transitions. This approach, however, tests mainly the load/store and function call mechanisms and less the handling of branches. If analysis of the final results shows that the load/store functionality of the processor is not exercised thoroughly, it may be a good addition to the benchmark (codesize allowing).

For input, the memory block will be initialized with comma separated values of mixed formats, as well as invalid inputs.

For the benchmark itself:
- Invoke the state machine on all of the input and count final states and state transitions. CRC of all final states and transitions will become part of the output chain.
- Modify the input at intervals (inject errors) and repeat the state machine operation.
- Modify the input back to original form.

The actual input must be initialized based on data that cannot be determined at compile time. In addition the intervals for modification of the input and the actual modification must be based on input that cannot be determined at compile time.
